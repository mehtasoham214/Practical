                Harry Potter is the main character in a immensely popular fantasy books written by J.K. Rowling. On his eleventh birthday, Harry finds out he's a wizard and gets to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. But his life hasn't been all sunshine and rainbows. His parents were killed by a bad wizard named Voldemort when he was a baby, and he had to grow up with his not-so-nice aunt and uncle.<br/>
                At Hogwarts, Harry makes great friends like Ron and Hermione, and together they face all sorts of challenges, from dealing with magical creatures to discovering dark secrets about Harry's past. The story gets pretty intense as they uncover Harry's special connection to Voldemort and realize he's got a big role to play in stopping the bad stuff happening in the magical world. As the books go on, the characters grow up, and they tackle big themes like friendship, bravery, and the fight between good and bad. The series, starting with "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," became a huge deal worldwide, even turning into blockbuster movies.</p>
