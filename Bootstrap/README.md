# Project Title

Created a single page website with nav banner, carousel, and cards using Bootstrap.

This is a mock-up of a home page for a business website. The page includes a header with the company logo and quick links to various sections of the site. The main header text "WE HELP YOUR BUSINESS" is prominently displayed, with a tagline below it describing the company's services ("SEO | BRANDING | LOGO").

The page layout includes a navigation menu with links to "Home", "Product", "Pricing", and "Contact Us" pages. There is also an email sign-up form with the label "Subscribe".

In the main content area, there is an introduction to the company and its products, with a call-to-action button labeled "LEARN MORE". There is also a section displaying customer testimonials and a section with information about the company's brand.

The footer of the page includes additional links, including "About Company", "Privacy Policy", and "Terms of Service". There is also a phone number and email address for contacting the company.

Overall, the page has a clean and modern design, with a white background and blue and gray accent colors. The layout is well-organized and easy to navigate, with clear labels and calls-to-action to encourage user engagement.
